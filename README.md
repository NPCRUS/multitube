# Multitube

You can watch youtube streams/videos in parallel and switch between different display mode: focused (one iframe is bigger then the others, but you can still see what happens on small ones and switch anytime), parallel (all iframes take same space). Originally this project was build to watch multiple table tennis matches with ability to focus on one of them, I suppose it can fit any other sport where you want to keep attention on multiple matches happening. If you have any usage ideas, bugs or suggestions - please create an issue. Powered by [elm-lang](https://elm-lang.org/)
